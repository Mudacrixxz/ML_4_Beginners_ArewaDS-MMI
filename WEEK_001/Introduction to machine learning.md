# Introduction to machine learning

## Machine Learning
Machine learning is a type, subset, or subfield of artificial intelligence and a modern software development techniques in which computers are enable to solve problems using examples of real world data.

## What is Machine Learning
Machine learning is type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn and improve from experience without explicitly being programmed.

Machine learning is a broader field of artificial intelligence(AI) in this field machine perform activities using human-like intelligence, machine learning is one of the most exciting branches of AI. It is used in healthcare, finance, agriculture, software development and more.

## Task or techniques of machine learning
### Supervised Machine Learning
is the process of training a model to learn from labelled training data, in this task every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it.

**Type of Supervised Learning**<br>
**Classification:** is when the output is categorized into different category such as, “Disease or No disease” “Spam or Not spam”. A categorical label has a discrete set of possible values, and it refers to taking an input value and mapping it to a discrete value.<br>
**Regression:**(continuous) a regression problem is when the output variable is a real or continuous value. Regression unlike classification it does not have a discrete set of possible values, which means there are potentially an unlimited number of possibilities.
### Unsupervised Machine Learning
it doesn’t require any training data with labels, in this task every training sample from the dataset has no corresponding label or output.

**Type of Unsupervised Learning**<br>
**Clustering:** is a type of unsupervised learning that helps to determine if their is any occurring groupings in the dataset, it find hidden patterns base on the data similirities or diffrence, it cluster different discrete values that are close to each other.
Reinforcement Learning
In this task the algorithm is trained in order to fiqure out which action to take to get reward and which action not to take to avoid penalties on the way of reaching a specific goal, the algorithm learn from experience and experimentation it learn from trial and error.


For instance we are training a dog. The dog will try and perform wrong things in response to commands you may issue, such as “come” or “catch”, and when the dog do the right thing you provide the dog with a reward such as: doggie biscuit. With time the dog learns from trial and error and the dog will understand that to get a reward it needs to correctly follow the right commands.

### Conclusion
Now, you know that Machine Learning is a technique of training machines to perform the activities a human brain can do, and even bit faster and better than an average human-being. We discussed the three major types of machine learning which are supervised, unsupervised and re enforcement with examples, you have seen that machines can be trained to perform human activities in several areas and can aid humans in living better lives.

Happy Learning…
